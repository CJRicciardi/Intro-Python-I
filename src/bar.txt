    Get up, stand up, stand up for your rights!
    Get up, stand up, don't give up the fight!

    Most people think,
    Great God will come from the skies
    Take away everything
    And make everybody feel high
    But if you know what life is worth
    You will look for yours on earth
    And now you see the light
    You stand up for your rights. Jah!

    Get up, stand up!
    Stand up for your rights!
